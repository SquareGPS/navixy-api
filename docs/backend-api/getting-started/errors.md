# Errors

This section provides detailed information on error handling in the Navixy API, including example error responses and descriptions of error codes.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs, the API returns a special error response. You can detect an error by checking the HTTP response code. If it is not `200 OK`, you should parse and handle the response body as an error response.

### Example Error Response

When an error occurs, the response will be in the following format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "status": {
    "code": 1,
    "description": "Database error"
  }
}
```

- `success` (boolean): Indicates if the request was successful.
- `status` (object): Contains details about the error.
  - `code` (integer): The error code.
  - `description` (string): A description of the error.

## Error Codes

Default HTTP code is `400`. Common error codes (should be handled for all API calls) are `1-100`, and resource or action-specific errors are `101-300`.

### Common Error Codes

| Code | Description                                                | HTTP Code |

## Best Practices for Error Handling

- **Check HTTP Status Codes**: Always check the HTTP status code of the response to determine if the request was successful.
- **Parse the Error Response**: If the status code indicates an error, parse the response body to obtain the error details.
- **Handle Specific Error Codes**: Implement handling for common error codes and resource-specific error codes to provide meaningful feedback to the user.
- **Retry Logic**: For transient errors (e.g., service unavailable, rate limits), implement retry logic with exponential backoff.
- **Logging**: Log error responses for debugging and monitoring purposes.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively handle errors in your application and provide a better experience for your users.
