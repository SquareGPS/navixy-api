If there was no driver change on the track, then the track will be returned entirely. 
Tracks selected by intersecting their date range with date range from request (`from` and `to` parameters).

| :------ | :------ | :----- |
| from | Include tracks which end after this date. | string |
| to | Include tracks which start before this date. | string |
| tracker_id | Id of the tracker. | int |
