Check-ins are created using Mobile Tracker App ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.navixy.xgps.tracker&hl=ru) / [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/x-gps-tracker/id802887190)).
They contain date/time, address, coordinates and additional information (comment, photo, filled form) which is provided by app
user after pressing the "Check-in" in the tracker app.
Using check-ins field personnel can provide information to their HQ while on site. For example, provide photo proof of the 
work done, or notify about a malfunction along with filled form describing the problem.

Check-ins cannot be created using web API, so all actions are read-only.
