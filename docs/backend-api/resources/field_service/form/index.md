# About forms

Forms used to provide additional information, such as user name, phone, delivery date, etc. upon task completion
or check-in from iOS/Android mobile tracker app.
Forms can be attached to tasks. If form attached to task, this task cannot be completed without form submission.

* Each form must be created from template, read more at [Templates](./template.md)
* For description of `<form_field>` and `<field_value>`, see [Form fields and values](./field-types.md)
* Using web API, it's now possible to only attach/fill forms with tasks (checkin forms are created through 
Android/iOS tracker applications). See [Task form actions](../task/form/index.md) to use forms with tasks.
