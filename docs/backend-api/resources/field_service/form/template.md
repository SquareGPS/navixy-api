# Form templates

Form is a "one-shot" entity; after it was filled by someone, it cannot be reused. It's stored along with filled fields 
for future reference. Usually people need to fill forms with the same fields over an over again, so forms are created on
 the basis of form templates. It's similar to paper forms: each paper form can be filled only once, but there's an 
 electronic document, a template, on basis of which all paper forms are printed.  
 
 The reason for such API design is that template fields can be changed over time (deleted, removed, reordered, etc)  
 and it should not affect already filled forms. By separating filled forms and templates, one can always view filled form 
 in exactly same state regardless of how template changed.
 
User can assign form to the task or checkin by choosing template without the need to create all form fields every time.

`<form_template>` is:
```js
{
  "id": 1,
  "label": "Order form", //user-defined form label, from 1 to 100 characters
  "fields": [
    //multiple <form_field> objects can be here
  ],
  "created": "2017-03-15 12:36:27", //date when this template was created. Read-only field
  "submit_in_zone": true, //if true, form can be submitted only in task zone
  "updated": "2017-03-16 15:22:53", //date when this template was last modified. Read-only field
  "default": false //if true,
}
```
