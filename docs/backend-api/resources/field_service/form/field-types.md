# Form fields and values

Every form (and form template) contains an ordered list of fields of various types. 
Field type defines how user input elements will look like, and how user input will be validated.

Every field has a set of common parameters, which are the same for all field types, and type-specific parameters, 
which define specific style and validation constraints. Both common and type-specific parameters contained as fields in
 the JSON object.

Field values for submitted form stored separately as JSON objects. The contents of value JSON objects are entirely 
field type-specific.

##### common field parameters:

```json
{
   "id": "Text-1",
   "label": "Name",
   "description": "Your full name",
   "required": true,
   "type": "text"
}
```

* `id` - arbitrary alphanumeric string (1 to 19 characters). Unique across current form's fields, used to link with 
values and its "parent" in template form.
* `label` - string. User-defined label, shown as field header, 1 to 100 printable characters.
* `description` - string. Field description, shown in smaller text under the header, 1 to 512 printable characters.
* `required` - boolean. If `true`, form cannot be submitted without filling this field with valid value.
* `type` - string. Determines field type.

### Text field

**type**: `text`.

Multiline auto-expanding text field.

**Note 1:** when value contains empty string, it's considered empty, and thus valid when `required: false, min_length != 0`.  
**Note 2:** combination `required: true, min_length: 0` is not allowed.

#### type-specific parameters:

```json
{
    "min_length": 5,
    "max_length": 255
}
```

* `min_length` - int. Minimum allowed length, from 0 to 1024.
* `max_length` - int. Maximum allowed length 1 to 1024.

#### value object:

```json
{
    "type": "text",
    "value": "text field value"
}
```

* `value` - string. What was entered the text field.

### Checkbox group

**type**: `checkbox_group`.

**Note 2:** combination `required: true, min_checked: 0` is not allowed.

##### type-specific parameters:

```json
{
    "min_checked": 0,
    "max_checked": 3,
    "group": [{
           "label" : "I agree to TOS"
    }]
}
```
    
* `min_checked` - int. Minimum allowed checked positions, 0 to "group".size - 1.
