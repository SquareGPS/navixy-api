# Scheduling tasks

Some tasks happen on regular basis, and it's tedious to create them by hand every time. Task schedules is the way to automate
this process. At the beginning of each day (moments after 00:00 AM according to [user's timezone setting](../../../commons/user/settings/index.md)),
schedule is checked and if there are tasks which start at this day, they are created and assigned to employees (if assignee is specified).

Schedule entries are very similar to tasks, main difference is that `from` and `to` containing specific date and time are
replaced with `from_time`, `duration` and `parameters`.

## Data structures

```js
<task_schedule_entry> = {
    "id": 111,   //primary key. used in update, *IGNORED* in create
    "user_id": 3,   //user id. *IGNORED* in create/update
    "tracker_id": 22, //id of the tracker to which all generated tasks are assigned. nullable.
    "location": {   //location associated with this task. cannot be null
        "lat": 56.5,
        "lng": 60.5,
        "address": "Moltkestrasse 32", //address of the location
        "radius": 150  //radius of location zone in meters
    },
    "label": "Shop",
    "description": "Buy things",
    "from_time": "12:34:00",  //time of day which defines start of the task within the days
    "duration": 60, //total duration in minutes between "from" and "to" for generated tasks
    "max_delay" : 5, //maximum allowed task completion delay in minutes
    "min_stay_duration": 0, //minumum duration of stay in task zone for task completion, minutes
    "min_arrival_duration": 0, // visits less than this values will be ignored, minutes
    "parameters": <schedule_parameters>, // can be "weekdays" or "month_days"
    "tags": [1, 2], //array of tag ids
    "form_template_id": 1 //int, form template id, nullable
}

<route_schedule_entry> = {
    "id": 111,   //primary key. used in update, *IGNORED* in create
    "user_id": 3,   //user id. *IGNORED* in create/update
    "tracker_id": 22, //id of the tracker to which all generated tasks are assigned. nullable.
    "label": "Shop",
    "description": "Buy things",
    "parameters": <schedule_parameters>, // can be "weekdays" or "month_days"
}

<checkpoint_schedule_entry> = {
    "id": 111,   //primary key. used in update, *IGNORED* in create
    "user_id": 3,   //user id. *IGNORED* in create/update
    "tracker_id": 22, //id of the tracker to which all generated tasks are assigned. nullable.
    "label": "Shop",
    "description": "Buy things",
    "parent_id": 1,
    "order": 0,
    "location": {   //location associated with this task. cannot be null
        "lat": 56.5,
        "lng": 60.5,
        "address": "Moltkestrasse 32", //address of the location
        "radius": 150  //radius of location zone in meters
    },
    "max_delay" : 5, //maximum allowed task completion delay in minutes
    "min_stay_duration": 0, //minumum duration of stay in task zone for task completion, minutes
    "min_arrival_duration": 0б // visits less than this values will be ignored, minutes
    "from_time": "12:34:00",  //time of day which defines start of the task within the days
    "duration": 60, //total duration in minutes between "from" and "to" for generated tasks
    "tags": [1, 2], //array of tag ids,
    "form_template_id": 1 //int, form template id, nullable
}
```

`<schedule_parameters>` can be one of the following:
```js
<weekdays> = { //task creation based on week day
    "type": "weekdays",
    "weekdays": [1, 5, 6] //week days on which tasks will be created (1 = Monday, ... 7 = Sunday)
}

<month_days> = { //task creation based on day of month
    "type": "month_days",
    "month_days": [1, 10, 31] //days of month on which tasks will be created (1..31)
}
```
