# Scheduling tasks

Some tasks happen on regular basis, and it's tedious to create them by hand every time. Task schedules is the way to automate
this process. At the beginning of each day (moments after 00:00 AM according to [user's timezone setting](../../../commons/user/settings/index.md)),
schedule checked and if there are tasks which start at this day, they are created and assigned to employees (if assignee specified).

Schedule entries are very similar to tasks, main difference is that `from` and `to` containing specific date and time 
replaced with `from_time`, `duration` and `parameters`.

## Task schedule entry object

```json
{
    "id": 111,
    "user_id": 3,
    "tracker_id": 22,
    "location": {
        "lat": 56.5,
        "lng": 60.5,
        "address": "Moltkestrasse 32",
        "radius": 150
    },
    "label": "Shop",
    "description": "Buy things",
    "from_time": "12:34:00",
    "duration": 60,
    "max_delay" : 5,
    "min_stay_duration": 0,
    "min_arrival_duration": 0,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "weekdays",
        "weekdays": [1, 5, 6]
    },
    "tags": [1, 2],
    "form_template_id": 1
}
```
