# Attaching files

API path: `/task/form/file`.


When submitting form values of type [file](../../form/field-types.md#file), [photo](../../form/field-types.md#photo) or
[signature](../../form/field-types.md#signature), you need to provide file id. To obtain it, first you [create](#create) 
a file entry, then upload a file using provided credentials. File must adhere to limitations specified in the form field.
Note that each file consumes space and contributes to file storage limit associated with user's account.

### create

Creates a new file entry associated with form's field. By making this call you basically "request permission" to upload
 a file. In return, you are provided with upload credentials (url, form fields, etc.).<br>
Note that in order to actually "include" file as form field's value, creating and uploading file is not enough.
 You must then submit a form with file id as a value of corresponding form field.

If file created but not uploaded, it will be deleted after date/time specified in "expires" response field.
 If file uploaded but not included as form field's value, it will be deleted on next form submission.

**required sub-user rights**: `task_update`.

| task_id | ID of the task to which form attached. | int |
| field_id | ID of the form's field to which a new file should be attached. | string |
| size | Maximum size in bytes for the file which will be uploaded. This is needed to "reserve" the space for a file in user's disk space quota. | int |

Here's an example of upload you must make after receiving such response (assuming you uploading image named `actual_file_name.png`):

```

Content-Length: 1325
Origin: http://bla.org
... other headers ...
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryePkpFF7tjBAqx29L

------WebKitFormBoundaryePkpFF7tjBAqx29L
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="token"

a43f43ed4340b86c808ac
------WebKitFormBoundaryePkpFF7tjBAqx29L
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="actual_file_name.png"
Content-Type: image/png

... contents of file goes here ...
------WebKitFormBoundaryePkpFF7tjBAqx29L--
```

#### errors

* 201 – Not found in the database - if there is no task with such an id, or task doesn't have form, or form has no
 field with such a field_id.
* 231 – Entity type mismatch - if form field is not file-based, i.e. doesn't use file id as its value.
* 255 – Invalid task state - if current task state is not "unassigned", "assigned" or "arrived", or if task's form 
not submitted at least once.
* 267 – Too many entities - if there 6 or more unsubmitted files already associated with this form's field.
* 268 – File cannot be created due to quota violation.
* 271 - File size is larger than the maximum allowed (by default 16 MB).
