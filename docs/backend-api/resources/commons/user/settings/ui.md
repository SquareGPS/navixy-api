# User UI settings

API path: `/user/settings/ui`

The user interface settings are intended for storing settings of client applications that use the API. 
One can imagine that this works similarly to the browser cache / local storage mechanism. The feature is that long-term storage of these settings is provided but not guaranteed - when the quota is exceeded, data could be deleted. 

### read

#### parameters

**key** - string. Length should be between 1 and 50 is 50 symbols, should only contain English letters, digits, '_' and '-'.


#### responses:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "value": "previously saved value"
}
```

When nonexistent key is provided:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "status": {
    "code": 201,
    "description": "Not found in database"
  }
}
```
