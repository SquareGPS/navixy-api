# Subuser security group

API path: `/subuser/security_group/`.

Contains API calls related to security groups, that is, groups of sub-users with the specified set of rights and privileges.

### Security group object structure

```json
${security_group} = {
      "id": 103, //group id, can be null (when creating new security group)
      "label": "Managers", //group label
      "privileges": {
        "rights": [
          "tag_update", "tracker_register" //a set of rights granted to security group (see below)
        ],
        "store_period": "1d" // optional, period of viewing history in legacy duration format, e.g. "2h" (2 hours), "3d" (3 days), "5m" (5 months), "1y" (one year)
      }
    }
```

### Default security group

Default (or empty) security group is the group which is effective when sub-users' "security_group_id" is null. It has empty "rights" array.

### Master user's rights

Master user always has all rights, including exclusive "admin" right.

### Security group rights

Absolute majority of read operations does not require any rights (that is, they are available to all sub-users, even with "null" security group). However, some entities may be hidden because they are associated with the trackers unavailable to sub-user.
Most f data-modifying operations, on the contrary, require some rights to be present.

Possible rights are:

*   admin, – master user-only, can't be assigned to security groups
*   tracker_update,
*   tracker_register,
*   tracker_rule_update,

*   zone_update,
