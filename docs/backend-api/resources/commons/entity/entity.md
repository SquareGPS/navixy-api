# Entity actions

Entity describes a class of objects for which representation and editable fields can be customized.
For example, you can add your own custom fields to **places** entity or rearrange existing fields.

**entity** is:
```js
<entity> = {
    "id": 123, //identifier
    "type": "place", //currently, only "place" is supported
    "settings": {
        "layout": { //describes layout of fields for entity.
                "sections": [ //each section can contain one or more fields. At least one section must exist in layout.
                  {
                    "label": "Section label",
                    "field_order": [ //built-in fields and ids of custom fields (as strings)
                      "label",
                      "location",
                      "131212",
                      "tags",
                      "description"
                    ]
                  }
                ]
              }
    }
