description: Tracker information
---

Tracker is one of the key entities in our API. It represents tracking device registered in our GPS monitoring system. Lots of API calls are created for manipulation of tracker and/or its properties.

## Tracker object structure

```js
{
    "id": {int}, // tracker id aka object_id
    "label": {string}, // tracker label
    "clone": {boolean}, // true if this tracker is clone
    "group_id": {int}, // tracker group id, 0 if no group
    "avatar_file_name" : {string}, // optional. passed only if present
    "source": {
        "id": {int}, // source id
        "device_id": {string}, // device id aka source_imei
        "model": {string}, // tracker model name from "models" table
        "blocked": {boolean}, // true if tracker was blocked due to tariff end
        "tariff_id": {int}, // id of tracker's tariff from "main_tariffs" table
        "status_listing_id": {int}, // id of the status listing associated with this tracker, or null
        "creation_date": "2011-09-21", // date when the tracker registered
        "tariff_end_date": "2016-03-24", // date of next tariff prolongation or null
        "phone" : {string} // phone of the device. can be null or empty if device has no GSM module or uses bundled SIM which number is hidden from the user
    }
    "tag_bindings": [{tag_binding}, ...} // list of attached tags. appears only for “tracker/list()“. 
}
```

where **tag_binding** is:

```js
{
  "tag_id": {int}, // id of tag. must be unique for tracker
  "ordinal": {int} // number that can be used as ordinal or kind of tag. must be unique for tracker. max value is 5
}
```

#### Id type:

Id type is used to determine the information needed to register device in our system (see [tracker/register(..)](#register)).

Possible values are:
- **imei** – means device uses IMEI as its identifier, e. g. “356938035643809”. See [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Equipment_Identity). When needed, you should pass only digits of IMEI, no spaces, minus signs, etc.
- **meid** means device uses MEID consisting of 14 HEX digits as its identifier, e. g. “A10000009296F2”. See [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_equipment_identifier).
- **id,n** – means device uses n-digit identifier (factory id with length n), for example, “id,7” means that you must pass 7-digit number, for example “1234567”
- **n,m** – n-digit generated id starting with m. This means that device has configurable ID and our platform generates and configures it automatically. You don’t need to pass any identifier during device registration in this case.

## register()

Registers a new tracker device. During registration, device is linked with current API user’s account and automatically configured to send data to our servers (if device model supports it). The panel must have installed SMS gateway.

**required subuser rights:** tracker_register

#### parameters:

**IMPORTANT**
Because of the variety of tracker models and business applications, there are many different ways to register tracker in our system. They are called [Registration plugins](../../commons/plugin/plugin.md). Each of registration plugins has its own set of additional parameters.

In addition to parameters specified in this section, you **must** pass all parameters which are required by the plugin you have chosen. See example below.

Common parameters are:
| name | description | type | format |
| :------ | :------ | :----- | :----- |
| label | User-defined label for this tracker. Must consist of printable characters and have length between 1 and 60 | string | Courier |
| group_id | Tracker group id, 0 if tracker does not belong to any group. The specified group must exist. See [group/list()](./group/group.md#list) | int | 0 |
| model | A code of one of the supported models. See [tracker/list_models()](#list_models) | string | pt10 |
| plugin_id | An id of a registration plugin which will be used to register the device. See [Registration plugins](../../commons/plugin/plugin.md) | int | 37 |
| device_id | **Must** be specified if device model uses fixed device id. See [tracker/list_models()](#list_models) | string | 4568005588562 |
| send_register_commands | Indicates send or not to send activation commands to device (via SMS or GPRS channel). If parameter is not specified or equals  `null` will be used the platform settings. Default: `null` | boolean | true/false |

#### example:

In this example we use plugin id = 37 (see [Plugin description](../../commons/plugin/plugin.md)) 
to register Queclink GV55Lite. We chose to include the device to default group, so group ID is 0. 
As this device is identified by IMEI, we include it as device ID (123451234512346).

Also we include **phone**, **apn_name**, **apn_user**, **apn_password** of the sim card installed in 
device and **activation_code** since this parameters are required by plugin.

You can try to “auto-detect” APN settings by phone number 
using [apn_settings/read(..)](./apn_settings/apn_settings.md#read) API call.

```abap
$ curl -X POST 'https://api.navixy.com/v2/tracker/register' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \ 
-d '{"hash": "a6aa75587e5c59c32d347da438505fc3", "label": "Courier", "group_id": "0", "plugin_id": "37", "model": "qlgv55lite", "phone": "79123122312", "activation_code": "123123123", "device_id": "123451234512346", "apn_name": "fast.tmobile.com", "apn_user": "tmobile", "apn_password": "tmobile"}'
```

#### response:

```js
{
    "success": true,
    "value": <tracker> //a newly created tracker
}
```

## send_command()

Sends command to tracker for performing special control, determined with "special_control" field of tracker model.

**required subuser rights:** tracker_configure, tracker_set_output

common command format is:

```js
"command":{
  "name": "command name", // required field
  "some_parameter1": <parameter value>, // parameters depends on certain command
  "some_parameter2": <parameter value>,
  ...
  "special_settings": { // optional field. its structure is defined with "special_control" field of tracker model
    "type": "settings type",
    "some_field1": <value>,
    "some_field2": <value>
    ...
  }
}
```

Certain commands which can be used is defined with `special_control` field of **tracker model** and corresponds the table below:
