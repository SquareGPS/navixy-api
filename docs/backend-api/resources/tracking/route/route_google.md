    }
```

* `errors` - [enum](../../../getting-started.md#data-types) array. Status.
    *   `NOT_FOUND` – indicates at least one of the locations specified in the request's origin, destination, or 
    waypoints could not be geocoded.
    *   `ZERO_RESULTS` – indicates no route could be found between the origin and destination.
    *   `MAX_WAYPOINTS_EXCEEDED` – indicates that too many waypoints provided in the request. The maximum allowed 
    waypoints is 8, plus the origin, and destination. Google Maps API for Business customers may contain requests with

    *   `INVALID_REQUEST` – indicates that the provided request was invalid. Common causes of this status include
