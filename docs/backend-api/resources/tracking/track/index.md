#### example

Let's consider an example, where we're looking for a KML file for a tracker with ID 1683258 that doesn't break down by stops. 
The data should cover trips starting from 3:24 AM to 6:24 AM on November 19, 2023, according to the user's local time.

=== "cURL"

    ```shell
    curl -X POST '{{ extra.api_example_url }}/track/download' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"hash": "22eac1c27af4be7b9d04da2ce1af111b", "tracker_id": 1683258, "from": "2023-11-19 03:24:00", "to": "2023-11-19 06:24:00", "format": "kml", "split": false}'
    ```

#### response

In case the available storage period is not exceeded, you will get the file.

For example, if the device's plan has maximum available storage period 3 months (default value) and we request data from 
6 months, the response will contain JSON with the next information: 

```json
{
  "list": [],
  "limit_exceeded": true,
  "success": true
}
```

#### errors

* 201 - Not found in database – the tracker ID in your request may not match any trackers linked to the user account with this 
session hash. Ensure the correct tracker_id and hash of an appropriate user are used.
* 208 - Device blocked – if a tracker exists under this user account but is currently inactive due to tariff plan 
restrictions or any other reason.
* 211 - Requested time span is too big – If the interval between the "from" and "to" dates is too large, it may exceed 
the maximum value defined in the API configuration.

#### example

For example, if we need to retrieve all trips for tracker 1683258 in November, without applying smart filter, including 
LBS points recorded, without clustering, separated by parkings, while also counting the number of events that occur during 
each trip, we only need to specify the "filter" and "count_events" from optional parameters. This is because the other optional 
settings will provide us with necessary info by default.

=== "cURL"

    ```shell
    curl -X POST '{{ extra.api_example_url }}/track/list' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"hash": "22eac1c27af4be7b9d04da2ce1af111b", "tracker_id": 1683258, "from": "2023-11-01 03:24:00", "to": "2023-11-30 06:24:00", "filter": false, "count_events": true}'
    ```

#### response

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "limit_exceeded": false,
    "list": [track_info]
}
```

* `limit_exceeded` - boolean. It will be `true` if the requested time period surpasses the limit set in the tracker's tariff. 
For instance, if the device's plan has a maximum storage period of three months (the default value), and we request trips 
for six months.
* `list` - an array of JSON objects containing track information. It consists of zero or more JSON objects. Zero objects 
indicates that there were no trips based on the track options or the device didn't supply any points to the platform.

where `track_info` is either `regular`, `single_report`, `merged` or `cluster`:

`regular` object:

* `points_list` - array of JSON objects. A list of [point info](#point-info).

`single_report` object is returned when the device operates in "interval" mode or only one point per track is provided 
(for example, an M7 tracker operating in interval mode):

```json
{
    "id": 123456,
    "start_date": "2023-11-24 03:39:44",
    "start_address": "1255 6th Ave, New York, NY 10020, USA",

  Used to distinguish this track type (`single_report`) from the others.
* `precision` - optional int. It signifies the precision of the location in meters. Its presence relies on the device model.
* `points_list` - array of JSON objects. A list of [point info](#point-info).

`merged` object. Only returned if "split" is set to `false`:

```json
{

#### errors

* 201 - Not found in database – the tracker ID in your request may not match any trackers linked to the user account with this
  session hash. Ensure the correct tracker_id and hash of an appropriate user are used.
* 208 - Device blocked – if a tracker exists under this user account but is currently inactive due to tariff plan
  restrictions or any other reason.
* 211 - Requested time span is too big – If the interval between the "from" and "to" dates is too large, it may exceed
  the maximum value defined in the API configuration.

are `true`, we should list them in our request.

=== "cURL"

    ```shell
    curl -X POST '{{ extra.api_example_url }}/track/read' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"hash": "22eac1c27af4be7b9d04da2ce1af111b", "tracker_id": 1683258, "track_id": 923150, "from": "2023-11-01 00:00:00", "to": "2023-11-01 23:59:59", "filter": false, "simplify": false, "include_gsm_lbs": false}'
    ```

#### response

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "limit_exceeded": true,
    "list": [point_info]
}
```

* `limit_exceeded` - boolean. It will be `true` if the requested time period surpasses the limit set in the tracker's tariff.
  For instance, if the device's plan has a maximum storage period of three months (the default value), and we request trips
  for six months.
* `list` - array of JSON objects. A list of [point info](#point-info).

#### point info

```json
{
    "lat": 43.0375133,
    "lng": -79.226505,
    "alt": 0,
    "satellites": 10,
    "mileage": 43.93,
    "get_time": "2023-11-01 04:38:39",
    "address": "Kottmeier Road, Thorold, Golden Horseshoe, Ontario, Canada, L3B 5N6",
    "heading": 280,
    "speed": 53,
    "precision": 100,
    "gsm_lbs": false,
    "parking": false,
    "buffered": true
}
```

* `lat` - float. Represents latitude.
* `lng` - float. Represents longitude.
* `alt` - int. Indicates the altitude in meters.
* `satellites` - int. Shows the number of GPS satellites used to determine this point.
* `mileage` - float. Represents mileage.
* `get_time` - [date/time](../../../getting-started.md#data-types). This is the GPS timestamp of the point, adjusted to the user's timezone.
* `address` - string. Represents the location's address. Will be "" if no address recorded. If no address has been recorded, it will appear as "". An address is recorded when it marks the beginning or end of a trip, or when an event occurs.
* `heading` - int. A value that represents the direction in degrees, with a range of 0 to 360. 0 corresponds to North.
* `speed` - int. A value representing speed in kilometers per hour.
* `precision` - optional int. A value indicating precision in meters. Its presence relies on the device model.
* `gsm_lbs` - optional boolean. It returns `true` if the location was detected by GSM LBS.
* `parking` - optional boolean. It will return true if the point does not correspond to a trip. [Parking detection](https://www.navixy.com/docs/user/web-interface-docs/devices-doc/parking-detection/) feature on the platform influences the categorization of points as either trip or parking states.
* `buffered` - optional boolean. It will return `true` if the point was initially saved in the device's memory and then sent to the server later. This parameter may vary based on the tracker model.

#### errors

* 201 - Not found in database – the tracker ID in your request may not match any trackers linked to the user account with this
  session hash. Ensure the correct tracker_id and hash of an appropriate user are used.
* 208 - Device blocked – if a tracker exists under this user account but is currently inactive due to tariff plan
  restrictions or any other reason.
* 211 - Requested time span is too big – If the interval between the "from" and "to" dates is too large, it may exceed
  the maximum value defined in the API configuration.
