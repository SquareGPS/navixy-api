# Track

API path: `/track`.

### download
Download track points as KML/KMZ file for the specified track ID, tracker and time period.

#### parameters
* **tracker_id** – **int**. ID of the tracker (aka "object_id"). Tracker must belong to authorized user and must not be blocked.
* **from** – **string**. A string containing date/time in `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` format (in user's timezone).
* **to** – **string**. A string containing date/time in `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` format (in user's timezone). Specified date must be after "from" date.
* **track_ids** – **array of int**. (optional) If specified, only points belonging to the specified tracks will be returned. If not, any valid track points between "from" and "to" will be returned.
* **include_gsm_lbs** – **boolean**. (optional, default=true) If false && track_ids not specified, GSM LBS points will be filtered out.
* **point_limit** – **int**. (optional) If specified, the returned track will be simplified to contain this number of points. Min=2, Max=3000.
* **filter** – **boolean**. (optional) If specified, the returned track will be filtered, applicable only for LBS tracks now.
* **format** – **string**. file format, "kml" or "kmz", default is "kml".
* **split** – **boolean**. If true, split tracks by folders with start/end placemarks and track line. default "false".

#### response
_KML/KMZ file_ or _JSON response_ if requested time period exceeds limit specified in tracker's tariff:
```json
{ 
    "success": true, 
    "list": [], 
    "limit_exceeded": true 
}
```

#### errors
*   204 (Entity not found) – if there is no tracker with such ID belonging to authorized user.
*   208 (Device blocked) – if tracker exists but was blocked due to tariff restrictions or some other reason.
*   211 (Requested time span is too big) – if interval between "from" and "to" is too big (maximum value is specified in API config.

### list
Get a list of track descriptions for the specified tracker and time period.

#### parameters
* **tracker_id** – **int**. ID of the tracker (aka “object_id”). Tracker must belong to authorized user and must not be blocked.
* **from** – **string**. A string containing date/time in `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` format (in user’s timezone)
* **to** – **string**. A string containing date/time in `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` format (in user’s timezone). Specified date must be after “from” date.
* **filter** – **boolean**. (optional, default=true) If true, tracks which are too short (in terms of length and number of points) will be omitted from resulting list.
* **split** – **boolean**. (optional, default=true) If false, all tracks will be merged into single one.
* **include_gsm_lbs** – **boolean**. (optional, default=true) If false, GSM LBS tracks will be filtered out.
* **cluster_single_reports** – **boolean**. (optional, default=false) If true, single point reports will be clustered by its coordinates.
* **count_events** – **boolean**. (optional, default=false) If true, number of events occurred during each non-singlepoint track will be returned.
