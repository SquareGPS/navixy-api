1.  tracker belongs to user and isn’t a _clone_.
2.  tracker’s tariff last changed more than **tariff.freeze.period** (config option. default 30 days) ago.
3.  **t1.tariff_id** != **t2.tariff_id**, i.e. new tariff must be differ from current.
4.  **t1.dealer_id** = **t2.dealer_id** = **dealer.effectiveDealerId**, i.e. current and new tariffs must belongs to user’s effective dealer
5.  **t2.active** = **1**, i.e. new tariff is _active_ (tariff’s option “Allow users to switch to this tariff independently” in **panel** is set **on**)
6.  **t1.grouping** = **t2.grouping**, i.e. user can change tariff only within one group of tariffs
7.  **t2.device** = **tracker**, i.e. new tariff must be for trackers
8.  new tariff is [available to user’s legal type](./index.md#tariff)

1.  user’s dealer if its **dealer_id** = **defaultDealerId** (config option) or **dogovor_type** = ‘paas’
2.  parent of user’s dealer elsewise
