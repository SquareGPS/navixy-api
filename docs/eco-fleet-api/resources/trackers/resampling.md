# Fuel data resampling
!!! note "Disclaimer: Navixy Eco Fleet Lab has developed this method, which provides a comprehensive fuel data analysis solution. The processed data can be utilized for various research, development, and diagnostic activities, driving further advancements including the usage of machine learning."

**The diagnostic process** is an important procedure undertaken by numerous partners and investigators. Its primary purpose is to identify the underlying causes, which is essential for efficient fuel management by identifying any abnormalities. For example, they analyze key events - drains and refueling for fraud or look for a reason for the appearance of noise in the fuel data.

When partners or integrators incorporate fuel-related data into third-party systems for **further analysis and processing, including machine learning**, it can be highly effective in identifying behavioral patterns and detecting exceptions. This allows for more efficient investigations and enhances overall data processing capabilities.

Effective data management relies on **accurate and synchronized raw data.** However, inconsistencies in different data sets (i.e. position, speed, and fuel level) across various timeframes can pose challenges.

To address issues of incomplete or inconsistent data, we employ statistical models. This API requests allows you to get and download **processed dataset** from the platform for the various period of time. This API request returns fuel related data in CSV format.

!!! note "**Data resampling** refers to the joint process of creating a uniform data structure by organizing existing values and generating new ones (for missing values) in a chronological order, while considering equal time intervals. This approach ensures data integrity and facilitates analysis."

## Description

The response is presented in a convenient CSV table format, incorporating columns below:

* Time - timestamp (depending on the timezone the tracker is located)
* [FUEL_SENSOR_NAME] - Fuel level (The column name is derived based on the sensor name. There could be more than 1 column)SPEED - object speed (km/h)
* MOVEMENT - movement status (0 - parking, 1 - moving, 2 - Idle)
* LNG - Longitude
* LAT - Latitude

**API path:** `/trackers/$tracker_id/resampling`

##### Description of resampling_method

* FOLLOWING - In this series, the subsequent value is utilized to substitute any missing values. Consequently, neighboring missing values are all substituted with the subsequent valid value. If there are any missing values at the end of the series, they are replaced with the preceding valid value. If delta is not null than algorithm changes: if the time interval [T-Δ, T+0] contains at least one value, otherwise fixed_value.
* PREVIOUS - The previous value in the series is utilized to substitute missing values. Consequently, the neighboring missing values are replaced with the earliest preceding valid value. If delta is not null than algorithm changes: if the time interval [T-0, T+Δ] contains at least one value, otherwise fixed_value.
* MEDIAN_IN_WINDOW - In this algorithm, the presence of delta is imperative. The average of all the neighboring values in the series within the interval [T-Δ, T+Δ], fixed_value if no values.
* AVERAGE_IN_WINDOW- In this algorithm, the presence of delta is imperative. The median of all the neighboring values in the series within the interval [T-Δ, T+Δ], fixed_value if no values.
* AVERAGE - To replace missing values in a series, we use the average of the two neighboring values. For any missing values between valid ones, we replace them with the average of the surrounding valid values. If the series begins or ends with missing values, we substitute them with the next or previous valid value accordingly. If delta is not equal to null than algorithm changes: if the interval [T-Δ, T+Δ] contains at least one value, otherwise fixed_value.
