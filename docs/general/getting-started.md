# Getting started

## How to read this documentation

Coming soon.

## Get involved

You can really help to improve [this documentation](./get-involved.md) o
 [localizations](./localizations/localizations.md) of Navixy Platform.

If the translation of the user interface into your language is missing or contains errors, 
you can make or fix the localization on the [CrowdIn platform](https://crowdin.com/) yourself. 
Read [here](./localizations/localizations.md) how to do it.

Current documentation may also contain errors or white spots. 
All of it is available in the public domain on [GitHub]({{ config.repo_url }}) and you can 
independently contribute in its correction or addition.
Read [here](./get-involved.md) how to do it.


## Useful things

It is convenient to [use postman](./postman.md) for testing work with API.
