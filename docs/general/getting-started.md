## API Limits

To ensure system stability for all customers, the platform limits API requests to 50 requests per second per user and per IP address (for applications serving multiple users). These limits are applied based on user session hash and API keys.

## Navixy API Sandbox

Navixy provides a powerful Postman collection, the Navixy API Sandbox, for working with API documentation, exploring, and testing API queries using real or demo data. This collection offers a familiar environment for many developers and simplifies the process of building customized solutions. For detailed information on using Postman with Navixy, please refer to the [Postman Guide](./postman.md).
