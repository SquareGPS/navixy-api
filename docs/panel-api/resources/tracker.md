**Conditions of the change**

The current dealer can change tracker tariff from `t1` to `t2`, if:

1. Tracker:
    1. is not removed
    1. belongs to the dealer's user
    1. is not a clone
1. `t1.tariff_id != t2.tariff_id`, i.e. it is impossible to change for the same tariff
1. `t1.dealer_id = t2.dealer_id = dealer.effectiveDealerId`, i.e. both tariffs belong to the current dealer
1. `t2.device = tracker`, i.e. only tracker tariffs are available
1. depending on `t2.doc_type`
    * doc_type=0 (for all) – without conditions
    * doc_type=1 (for the physical persons) – user.face=1 (physical person)
    * doc_type=2 (for legal entities) – user.face=2 (legal entity) or user.face=3 (SP)
    * doc_type=3 (paas) – without conditions
1. `t2.device_limit >= count` of trackers in user's cabinet.

**Repayment**

Repayment is carried out if the following conditions are met:

1. the "repay" flag is set (repay)
2. current tariff – monthly: t1.type = monthly
3. tariff – paid: tariff.price > 0
4. that the current tariff didn't end (tariff_end != 1)
5. the tariff expiration date is defined: tariff_end_date != 0 (for monthly tariffs it has to be carried out always)
6. the free period expired: created_date + free_period <= current date,
where free_period obtained from the hardcodes table or from default_model_settings
7. there is still at least one paid day on a tariff: reminder > 0
The rest of days on a tariff: remainder = the number of whole days before the end of the current tariff.

amount to be repaid = `ceil(tariff.price * remainder / amt)`,
where `amt` – the number of days in the current month, а ceil – the operation of taking the integer part

**Change**

```abap
tariff_id = next_tariff = new tariff id
tariff_change = current date
if tariff is active (tariff_end = false) then
    tariff_end = false
    last_charged_date = current date
    if new tariff is monthly and the flag "to charge" is not set (charge) then
        tariff_end_date = the first day of the next month from the current date
    else
        tariff_end_date = tomorrow date
else (tariff is not active: tariff_end = true)
    last_charged_date = yesterday date
    if new tariff is monthly then
        if the flag "to charge" is set (charge) then
            tariff_end_date = current date
            tariff_end = true
        else
            tariff_end_date = the first day of the next month from the current date
            tariff_end = false
    if the new tariff is everyday then
        if the flag "to charge" is set(charge) then
            tariff_end_date = current date
            tariff_end = true
        else
            tariff_end_date = tomorrow date
            tariff_end = false
    if the new tariff is activeday then
        tariff_end_date = 0
        tariff_end = false
```

All dates according to UTC time.
