# Raw Data

Navixy DataWarehouse API empowers you to extract every piece of data transmitted by your connected devices, quickly and efficiently. This page covers the API methods that allow you to obtain raw, unprocessed data, providing the necessary granularity for in-depth analysis.

This API allows you to retrieve parsed raw data from the platform for periods ranging from one to several months (depending on your plan). You can obtain parsed GPS and sensor data that the device sends, including input statuses, data from analog and digital interfaces, wireless interfaces, and counters.

!!! note "Parsed raw data — Data obtained immediately after decoding (parsing) incoming data packets, considering the protocol and specifics of the device model from which the packets were received."

The Navixy DataWarehouse API provides the following key methods for accessing raw data:

- **`get_inputs`**: Retrieve the available metering inputs and state fields of a device.
- **`read`**: Fetch parsed raw data values received from tracking devices and decoded by the platform.

## API Actions

API base path: `/tracker/raw_data/`

### `get_inputs`

Returns available metering inputs and state fields of a device.

Before requesting raw data, it is crucial to comprehend the device's data capabilities and the specific names of the data input and state fields it possesses.

It's important to note that this API request does not provide actual device data. Rather, it serves as a supplementary request aimed at gaining insights into the fields, which data that can be obtained subsequently.

#### Parameters

| name       | description                                                                                                                                         | type | format |
|:-----------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----|:-------|
| tracker_id | ID of the tracker (aka "object_id"). The tracker must be associated with the user whose hash is being used for the request, and not tariff-blocked. | int  | 123456 |

#### Example

```

* `discrete_inputs` - int. A number of discrete inputs.
* `discrete_outputs` - int. A number of discrete outputs.
* `inputs` - string array. A list of available metering inputs.
* `states` - string array. A list of available state fields.

If there is more than one input of the same type, they are indexed (1, 2, 3...). In this case, only the input with the maximum index is returned.

For example:

* If LLS Levels from 1 to 4 are available, `lls_level_4` is returned, and it is assumed that LLS levels 1 through 3 also exist. 
* If AVL IOs from 1 to 100000 are available for a device, `avl_io_100000` is returned, and AVL IOs with smaller indexes also exist.

#### Errors

* 201 – Not found in the database – tracker ID does not exist.
* 204 – Entity not found – there is no tracker with such ID belonging to the authorized user.
* 208 – Device blocked – tracker exists but was blocked due to tariff restrictions or some other reason.

### `read`

Retrieves parsed raw data - values received from tracking devices and decoded by the platform.

!!! note "The names and values of the inputs and state fields returned by this request align with the names visible in [Air Console](https://docs.navixy.com/admin-panel/air-console) when connecting to a device. You can find them in the right column, where the incoming data is decoded."

!!! note "Instead of using `from`/`to` parameters it is possible to set `interval` parameter - ISO 8601 formatted interval, for example 2023-08-24T08:04:36.306Z/PT24H."

The response is provided in a CSV format file, with columns that are predefined in the `columns` parameter of the API request.
Here are the specifications for the table output:

* Rows are enclosed in double quotes. A double quote inside a string is output as two double quotes in a row. There are no other rules for escaping characters.
* Date and date-time are enclosed in double quotes.
* Numbers are output without quotes.
* Values are separated by a comma character `,`.
* Rows are separated using the Unix line feed (LF).
* `NULL` is represented as `\N`.
* Requested column can be a simple or complex.

**Simple** columns:

* `msg_time` - time of message sent by the device. Always returned in CSV output and does not need to be requested separately. Indicated according to user account time zone.
* `server_time` - time of message processing by the server.
* `gps_fix_type` - enum. One of `UNKNOWN`, `NO_FIX`, `HAS_FIX`, `LAST_KNOWN_POSITION`.
* `lat` - float. Latitude.
* `lng` - float. Longitude.
* `speed` - decimal. Speed, km/h.
* `alt` - int. Altitude, meters.
* `satellites` - int. Satellites count (`-1` = unknown).
* `heading` - int. Heading degrees.
* `precision` - int. Location precision, meters.
* `hdop` - float. Horizontal dilution of precision (`-1` = unknown).
* `pdop` - float. Position dilution of precision (`-1` = unknown).
* `event_id` - int. Event ID.
* `mn_name` - string. Mobile network name.
* `mn_roaming` - int. Roaming status (`0` = no roaming, `1` = roaming, `-1` = unknown).
* `mn_code` - int. Mobile network operator code.
* `mn_csq` - int. Mobile network signal strength, CSQ, values from 0 to 31 (`99` = unknown).
* `mn_type` - enum. Mobile network type, one of `UNKNOWN`, `GSM`, `CDMA`, `WCDMA`, `LTE`, `NR`.

**Complex** columns:

* `flags` - bitmap of flags:
    * bit 0 `location_valid`: `0` = location invalid, `1` = location valid.
    * bit 1 `lbs`:  `0` = GPS, `1` = LBS.
    * bit 2 `soft_lbs`:  `0` = device LBS, `1` = software LBS.
* `discrete_inputs` - map of discrete inputs states, inputs enumerated from 1.
* `discrete_outputs` - map of discrete outputs states, outputs enumerated from 1.
* `inputs` - map of metering inputs values. Inputs list depends on the device.
* `states` - map of various states. States list depends on the device.

To retrieve an internal value from a complex column, use the period symbol. For example: `flags.location_valid`, `inputs.board_voltage`. Unknown internal values will be returned as `NULL`.

The list of available internal values for a particular device is obtained using the `get_inputs` method described above.

If you specify a complex column without specifying an internal value, then all internal values will be returned as a JSON map (except flags that will be returned as an integer).

You can append complex columns with an asterisk symbol:

* `inputs.*`
* `states.*`
* `discrete_inputs.*`
* `discrete_outputs.*`

In this case, the platform will search for all available columns in the specified data range and then request them from the database. In the resulting CSV output, instead of the column with an asterisk, all the existing columns in alphabetical order will be shown. If there are no columns, they will not be included in the response.

#### Example for Searching by Server Time Additionally

This API is designed to accommodate scenarios where you retrieve information from trackers to your applications within specified time intervals. Occasionally, trackers may experience connectivity issues. During such occurrences, these trackers automatically store information in their memory buffers. Upon re-establishing a connection, devices promptly transmit their stored information to the platform.

For instance:

A tracker was connected from 10:00 to 10:30. It then loses GSM signal, storing information in its buffer from 10:30 to 12:00. At 12:00, it reconnects and begins sending packets from the buffer. These packets are timestamped with message times starting from 10:30, 10:31, and so forth. However, the server time reflects 12:00, 12:01, and so on. If your program requests data from 10:00 to 11:00 at 11:00 without utilizing the `server_time_filter` parameter, it will receive messages only from 10:00 to 10:30. The program might not be aware that it needs to re-request this data once all data from the buffer has been uploaded.

To address such situations, there is optional filtering using the `server_time_filter` parameter. This ensures that your program will get all buffered information. This approach helps prevent potential data gaps and enhances the reliability of your application.
