# Creating a custom asset

An asset represents a trackable unit with a clear business purpose. While assets are stored in the system independently, using them involves assigning them activated GPS devices — or, in the API terms, **inventory items**. Multiple items can be assigned to a single asset.

Each asset belongs to a specific type that defines its structure and allows you to add user-defined properties called **custom fields**. Those asset types act as templates that determine what information can be stored for each category of asset.

In this guide, you will learn how to create and configure a custom asset.

### How to create a custom asset

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that {BASE\_URL} in sample requests is a placeholder for the URL you'll be using, which depends on your geographical location and the current version of the API. To learn the specific server URLs, see [API environments](../technical-reference.md#api-environments).
{% endhint %}

#### Step 1. Create an asset type

Each asset is based on an asset type — the schema that determines its properties. If your asset is a Ford F-150, your asset type might be called "Pickup Truck." This guide describes creating a commercial vessel.

{% openapi-schemas spec="navixy-repo" schemas="AssetType" grouped="true" %}
[OpenAPI navixy-repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SquareGPS/navixy-api/refs/heads/navixy-repo/docs/navixy-repository-api/resources/navixy-repo-api-specification.yaml)
{% endopenapi-schemas %}

To create a new asset type, send the following request:

{% openapi-operation spec="navixy-repo" path="/v0/asset_type/create" method="post" %}
[OpenAPI navixy-repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SquareGPS/navixy-api/refs/heads/navixy-repo/docs/navixy-repository-api/resources/navixy-repo-api-specification.yaml)
{% endopenapi-operation %}

Use this request body:

```bash
curl -X POST {BASE_URL}/asset_type/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "label": "Commercial Vessel",
  "category": "business",
  "fields": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "label": "Vessel Name",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "label": "Registration Number",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "type": "decimal",
      "label": "Engine Power",
      "required": false
    },
    {
      "type": "decimal",
      "label": "Max Passengers",
      "required": false
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "layout": {
      "sections": [
        {
          "label": "Vessel Information",
          "fields": [
            "Vessel Name",
            "Registration Number"
          ]
        },
        {
          "label": "Technical Specifications",
          "fields": [
            "Engine Power",
            "Max Passengers"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}'
```

Aside from the `label` of the asset type, the request body contains the following parameters: `category`, `settings,` and `fields`.

The available categories are `business` for moving assets and `geo` for stationary.

The **`settings`** key defines the structure of sections and fields belonging to your asset type. This object contains a `layout` property that describes how the asset form is split into logical sections and the order of fields within each section. The layout consists of sections, where each section has:

* `label`: Section name
* `fields`: List of fields to be displayed in the specified order inside the section

The **`fields`** key is an array of custom field objects used to add user-created information to assets, allowing for enhanced customization and data management. Each field includes:

* `type`: Field type (text, decimal, geojson, bigtext, integer, master\_item)
* `label`: Field name
* `required`: Whether the field is mandatory
* `description`: An optional description

<details>

<summary>Field type descriptions</summary>

* **Text**: A short text value.\
  `{"value":"Example text"}`

- **Bigtext**: A large text value for storing long user input or multi-line content.\
  `{value":"Longer text or content spanning multiple lines..."}`
- **Integer**: A whole number (not a fraction or decimal).\
  `{"value":100}`
- **Decimal**: A decimal (fixed-point) value.\
  `{"value":123.45}`
- **GeoJSON**: A GeoJSON value (geometry, feature, or feature collection). Typically used for describing geofences.\
  `{value":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[30,10]}}`
- **Master item**: A reference to a master inventory item using its unique internal ID.\
  `{"value":123}`

</details>

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you remove a custom field from an asset type via [**asset\_type/update**](../endpoint-reference/asset-type.md#post-v0-asset_type-update), all assets based on this type will lose this field. If you add a new field marked as required, you will need to add values for that field to the assets.
{% endhint %}

After sending the request, you will receive a response with the ID of the newly created asset type:

```json
{
  "id": 456
}
```

#### Step 2. Fetch custom field IDs

Before creating an asset, you need to learn the auto-generated internal ID of each custom field you've added in Step 1. You can learn them by sending the following request using the asset type's own ID:

{% openapi-operation spec="navixy-repo" path="/v0/asset_type/read" method="get" %}
[OpenAPI navixy-repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SquareGPS/navixy-api/refs/heads/navixy-repo/docs/navixy-repository-api/resources/navixy-repo-api-specification.yaml)
{% endopenapi-operation %}

In this case, it will be:

```bash
curl -X GET "{BASE_URL}/asset_type/read?id=456" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

You will receive full information about the asset type, including the `id` of each custom field. Save them for later.

```json
{
    "id": 25,
    "label": "Commercial Vessels",
    "category": "business",
    "settings": {
        "layout": {
            "sections": [
                {
                    "label": "Vessel Information",
                    "fields": [
                        "Vessel Name",
                        "Registration Number"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "label": "Technical Specifications",
                    "fields": [
                        "Engine Power",
                        "Max Passengers"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    "fields": [
        {
            "id": 55,
            "label": "Vessel Name",
            "required": true,
            "description": "",
            "type": "text"
        },
        {
            "id": 56,
            "label": "Registration Number",
            "required": true,
            "description": "",
            "type": "text"
        },
        {
            "id": 57,
            "label": "Engine Power",
            "required": false,
            "description": "",
            "type": "decimal"
        },
        {
            "id": 58,
            "label": "Max Passengers",
            "required": false,
            "description": "",
            "type": "decimal"
        }
    ],
    "created_at": "2025-07-09T11:57:36.003383Z"
}
```

#### Step 3. Create an asset

{% openapi-schemas spec="navixy-repo" schemas="Asset" grouped="true" %}
[OpenAPI navixy-repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SquareGPS/navixy-api/refs/heads/navixy-repo/docs/navixy-repository-api/resources/navixy-repo-api-specification.yaml)
{% endopenapi-schemas %}

{% openapi-operation spec="navixy-repo" path="/v0/asset/create" method="post" %}
[OpenAPI navixy-repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SquareGPS/navixy-api/refs/heads/navixy-repo/docs/navixy-repository-api/resources/navixy-repo-api-specification.yaml)
{% endopenapi-operation %}

To create an asset, send the following request using the `id` of each custom field from the previous step, or at least those marked as `required:`

```bash
curl -X POST {BASE_URL}/asset/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "type_id": 456,
  "label": "Sea Explorer",
  "fields": {
    "55": {
      "type": "text",
      "value": "Sea Explorer"
    },
    "56": {
      "type": "text",
      "value": "BOT-2024-001"
    },
    "57": {
      "type": "decimal",
      "value": 350.5
    },
    "58": {
      "type": "decimal",
      "value": 12
    }
  }
}'
```

You will receive the ID of the newly created asset:

```json
{
  "id": 789
}
```

#### Step 4. Assign a GPS device

Now that you have an asset, you need to assign a device to it. This is done by adding the `asset_id` parameter to the inventory item (master or slave) representing the device. You can assign several devices to one asset — or, in the API's terms, add the same `asset_id` to several inventory items.

Navixy Repository API allows for flexible device assignment:

* **Assign during device creation**: Include `asset_id` when creating the inventory item
* **Assign to existing device**: Update an existing inventory item with `asset_id`
* **Assign later**: Create devices without assets and assign them when needed

This flexibility allows you to pre-create devices in inventory before assets exist, reassign devices between assets as needed, and manage unassigned spare devices.

**Assign to an existing device**

If your device is already activated, send the following request (let's assume you have a master-type item called  `GPS Tracker 446`):

```json
curl -X POST {BASE_URL}/inventory_item/master/update \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "id": 123,
  "inventory_id": 12,
  "label": "GPS Tracker 446",
  "asset_id": 789
}'
```

**Assign during device creation**

If you haven't created an inventory item yet, you can add the `asset_id` parameter to the creation request. For a master item, send the following request:

```json
​curl -X POST {BASE_URL}/inventory_item/master/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "inventory_id": 12,
    "device_id": "123456789012345",
    "label": "GPS Tracker 446",
    "model": "telfmu130_fmc130_234",
    "asset_id": 789
}'
```

{% hint style="success" %}
**Congratulations!**\
You've successfully created a custom asset. Next, you can [add it to an asset link](configuring-an-asset-link.md).
{% endhint %}
