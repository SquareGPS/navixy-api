How to use the data transmitted by the device

Activating the GPS device registers it with other Navixy systems: [Navixy API](https://www.navixy.com/docs/navixy-api/), a telematics platform without comprehensive business management features, and [IoT Logic](https://www.navixy.com/docs/iot-logic-api), a low-code data processing and enrichment tool.

Activation allows you to work with the device in other APIs:

* Fetch the device's telemetrics via [Navixy API](https://www.navixy.com/docs/navixy-api/user-api/backend-api/guides/data-retrieval/get-track-points)
* Enrich the received data with [IoT Logic via Websocket](https://www.navixy.com/docs/iot-logic-api/websocket-access-for-dsa)
* Send its data to an external system via [IoT Logic and MQTT](https://www.navixy.com/docs/iot-logic-api/navixy-iot-guide/scenario1)
