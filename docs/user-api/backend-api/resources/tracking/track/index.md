# Track

This section includes API calls that allow you to interact with tracks and retrieve track points.

Learn more about the track API by following our [instructions](../../../guides/data-retrieval/get-track-points.md).


## API actions

API path: `/track`.

### `download`

This method allows you to download track points as a KML/KMZ file which can be used in other apps to show tracks.

#### Parameters

| tracker_id      | ID of the tracker (aka "object_id"). The tracker must be associated with the user whose hash is being used for the request, and not tariff-blocked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | int                                                       | `123456`                |
| from            | The start date/time for your KML file's track points. The file begins with the next point after this time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [date/time](../../../getting-started/introduction.md#datetime-formats) | `"2020-09-23 03:24:00"` |
| to              | An end date/time for your KML file's track points. The file concludes with the last point before this time. Ensure this date is later than the "from" date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [date/time](../../../getting-started/introduction.md#datetime-formats) | `"2020-09-23 06:24:00"` |

| point_limit     | Optional. If it is specified and `simplify=true`, the returned tracks in a file will be reduced to contain that specified number of points. The minimum value is 2, and the maximum is 3000. If it is not specified, the server's default settings for simplifying tracks will be applied. This is not a strict limit; the returned file can potentially contain more points than specified.  | int                                                       | `300`                   |
| filter          | Optional. If this is set to `true`, the returned tracks in a file will be filtered.

| split           | If set to `true`, tracks in the file will be split by stops into folders with start/end markers. Default is`false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | boolean                                                   | `false`                 |

#### Example

Let's consider an example, where we're looking for a KML file for a tracker with ID 1683258 that doesn't break down by stops. 
The data should cover trips starting from 3:24 AM to 6:24 AM on November 19, 2023, according to the user's local time.

=== "cURL"

    ```shell
    curl -X POST '{{ extra.api_example_url }}/track/download' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"hash": "22eac1c27af4be7b9d04da2ce1af111b", "tracker_id": 1683258, "from": "2023-11-19 03:24:00", "to": "2023-11-19 06:24:00", "format": "kml", "split": false}'
    ```

#### Response

In case the available storage period is not exceeded, you will get the file.

For example, if the device's plan has maximum available storage period 3 months (default value) and we request data from 
6 months, the response will contain JSON with the next information: 

```json
{
  "list": [],
  "limit_exceeded": true,
  "success": true
}
```

#### Errors

* 201 - Not found in database – the tracker ID in your request may not match any trackers linked to the user account with this 
session hash. Ensure the correct tracker_id and hash of an appropriate user are used.
* 208 - Device blocked – if a tracker exists under this user account but is currently inactive due to tariff plan 
restrictions or any other reason.
* 211 - Requested time span is too big – If the interval between the "from" and "to" dates is too large, it may exceed 
the maximum value defined in the API configuration.


### `list`

This method retrieves a list of tracks for a given tracker within a specified time period.

#### Parameters

#### Example

For example, if we need to retrieve all trips for tracker 1683258 in November, without applying smart filter, including 
LBS points recorded, without clustering, separated by parkings, while also counting the number of events that occur during 
each trip, we only need to specify the "filter" and "count_events" from optional parameters. This is because the other optional 
settings will provide us with necessary info by default.

=== "cURL"

    ```shell
    curl -X POST '{{ extra.api_example_url }}/track/list' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"hash": "22eac1c27af4be7b9d04da2ce1af111b", "tracker_id": 1683258, "from": "2023-11-01 03:24:00", "to": "2023-11-30 06:24:00", "filter": false, "count_events": true}'
    ```

#### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "limit_exceeded": false,
  "list": [track_info]
}
```

* `limit_exceeded` - boolean. It will be `true` if the requested time period surpasses the limit set in the tracker's tariff. 
For instance, if the device's plan has a maximum storage period of three months (the default value), and we request trips 
for six months.
* `list` - an array of JSON objects containing track information. It consists of zero or more JSON objects. Zero objects 
indicates that there were no trips based on the track options or the device didn't supply any points to the platform.

#### Errors

* 201 - Not found in database – the tracker ID in your request may not match any trackers linked to the user account with this
session hash. Ensure the correct tracker_id and hash of an appropriate user are used.
* 208 - Device blocked – if a tracker exists under this user account but is currently inactive due to tariff plan
restrictions or any other reason.
* 211 - Requested time span is too big – If the interval between the "from" and "to" dates is too large, it may exceed
the maximum value defined in the API configuration.


### `read`

This method fetches all track points that a GPS tracker has recorded and sent to the platform within a specified time 
frame. The timestamp for each point corresponds to when the tracker recorded the point, adjusted to the user's time zone.

If set to `false`, the response will include parking points.                                                                                                                                                                                          | boolean                                                   | false                 |

#### Example

For instance, if we need to obtain track points for tracker 1683258 that fall within November 1, and are solely part of 
track ID 923150, without applying a smart filter, LBS points and simplifier. Since these optional parameters by default 
are `true`, we should list them in our request.

=== "cURL"

    ```shell
    curl -X POST '{{ extra.api_example_url }}/track/read' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"hash": "22eac1c27af4be7b9d04da2ce1af111b", "tracker_id": 1683258, "track_id": 923150, "from": "2023-11-01 00:00:00", "to": "2023-11-01 23:59:59", "filter": false, "simplify": false, "include_gsm_lbs": false}'
    ```

#### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "limit_exceeded": true,
  "list": [point_info]
}
```

* `limit_exceeded` - boolean. It will be `true` if the requested time period surpasses the limit set in the tracker's tariff.
For instance, if the device's plan has a maximum storage period of three months (the default value), and we request trips
for six months.
* `list` - array of JSON objects. A list of [point info](#point-info).

#### point info

```json
{
  "lat": 43.0375133,
  "lng": -79.226505,
  "alt": 0,
  "satellites": 10,
  "mileage": 43.93,
  "get_time": "2023-11-01 04:38:39",
  "address": "Kottmeier Road, Thorold, Golden Horseshoe, Ontario, Canada, L3B 5N6",
  "heading": 280,
  "speed": 53,
  "precision": 100,
  "gsm_lbs": false,
  "parking": false,
  "buffered": true
}
```

* `lat` - float. Represents latitude.
* `lng` - float. Represents longitude.
* `alt` - int. Indicates the altitude in meters.
* `satellites` - int. Shows the number of GPS satellites used to determine this point.
* `mileage` - float. Represents mileage.
* `get_time` - [date/time](../../../getting-started/introduction.md#data-types). This is the GPS timestamp of the point, adjusted to the user's timezone.
* `address` - string. Represents the location's address. Will be "" if no address recorded. If no address has been recorded, it will appear as "". An address is recorded when it marks the beginning or end of a trip, or when an event occurs.
* `heading` - int. A value that represents the direction in degrees, with a range of 0 to 360. 0 corresponds to North.
* `speed` - int. A value representing speed in kilometers per hour.
* `precision` - optional int. A value indicating precision in meters. Its presence relies on the device model.
* `gsm_lbs` - optional boolean. It returns `true` if the location was detected by GSM LBS.
* `parking` - optional boolean. It will return true if the point does not correspond to a trip. [Parking detection](https://www.navixy.com/docs/user/web-interface-docs/devices-doc/parking-detection/) feature on the platform influences the categorization of points as either trip or parking states.
* `buffered` - optional boolean. It will return `true` if the point was initially saved in the device's memory and then sent to the server later. This parameter may vary based on the tracker model.

#### Errors

* 201 - Not found in database – the tracker ID in your request may not match any trackers linked to the user account with this
session hash. Ensure the correct tracker_id and hash of an appropriate user are used.
* 208 - Device blocked – if a tracker exists under this user account but is currently inactive due to tariff plan
restrictions or any other reason.
* 211 - Requested time span is too big – If the interval between the "from" and "to" dates is too large, it may exceed
the maximum value defined in the API configuration.
