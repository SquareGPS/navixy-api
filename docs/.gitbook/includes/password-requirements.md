{% hint style="danger" %}
Passwords must be between 12 and 20 characters in length and include at least one uppercase letter, lowercase letter, digit, and special character (!@#$%^&\*). To maintain account security, the system tracks password history, so you can't reuse any of your last 10 passwords. If a previous password is detected, the system will return the error "Password was recently used."
