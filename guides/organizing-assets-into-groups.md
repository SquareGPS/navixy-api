# Organizing assets into groups

In Navixy Repository API, **asset groups** are user-created collections of assets grouped by a certain principle, such as a truck, a trailer, and the equipment it carries, or vehicles parked at a specific site. These groups help organize and manage assets that work together or have logical relationships.

An asset group can contain assets of all types. Groups automatically manage asset relationships and handle reassignments when assets are moved between groups.

In this guide, you will learn about how asset groups are structured, how to create them, and how to assign assets to them.

### How to configure an asset group
